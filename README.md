### Welcome to the 2023 PARADIM JHU Summer School on [Data Driven Materials Discovery](https://www.paradim.org/2023_JHU_SS)!

[School Agenda Linked Here](https://www.paradim.org/2023_JHU_SS)

###### This repo provides some of the shared resources for the school including notebooks and links used in lectures or for hands-on experiments/investigations.

#### Some Tool Info to Prepare:

* https://nanohub.org/tools/compphasestab  (Ale’s example: let’s get a Materials Project API Key and run it)
* Install XtalOpt with GULP (needed tomorrow):
 * XtalOpt install:  http://xtalopt.github.io/download.html
 * GULP :  https://gulp.curtin.edu.au/download.html
 * Start XtalOpt!  (For the Mac you may have to control-click to allow it to open since it is a non-registered developer.)
* SciServer JupyterLab:  
  * Make Compute Container
  * Browse to your temporary storage and git clone https://github.com/paradimdata/2023_JHU_Summer_School
  * Try nanoHUB_remote pymnatgen example

#### Telegrams and Tools Day-by-Day

##### Day 1
1. ML is both revolutionary and evolutionary.  
Transformative tools/Learn from the data
Makes physic-based modeling more accurate/better predictions
2. ML is more about prediction or speed and less about understanding the physics of a system 
3. Small amount of code + FAIR repository +computational platform = scaling from simple to meaningful
go from pencil-and-paper example to all the structures in a repository
Features/Descriptors are high value.
4. Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration/visualization; query and computation from repositories; transparency; ubiquitous in data science and AI/ML
5. Major materials data infrastructure: nanoHUB, Materials Project, AFLOW, OpenKIM, OQMD, NREL MatDB

##### Day 2
1. ML can be “black box”   
When is this a problem? When is it not?  How does one use machine learning?
What does it mean if your black box
2. Tools use data. Databases are changing relatively fast. 
3. ML is often split into three types: Clustering, Classification, Regression. What are some problems 
4. Important Databases are the fuel: Materials Project, OQMD, ICSD… make a list! [Check out someone else's list!](https://github.com/tilde-lab/awesome-materials-informatics)  
 * What do we have?
 * What do we need?  
5. Mithrel makes predictions
6. Start poking at community databases
